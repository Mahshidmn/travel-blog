# Travel Blog by James, Mahshid, Jordan & Hayley

## About
As a group of four people who love travelling and taking photos, we built a social media app that is focused on Travelling. 

Users can upload a post (which consists a photo, country, title and context) after loggin in and the comment section lets users to communicate with each other. 

Gallery page is purely focused on posting photos, so if you want to see all the fascinating photos taken around the world, head to the Gallery page.

In My Blog page, you can manage your profile photo, bio, map and posts that you uploaded.
